# Crash Twinsanity Editor
>Original made by Neo_Kesha

## Description
This is a rewrite of Crash Twinsanity Editor, simply called TwinsanityEditor(TE). The original was writtern in VB and is now in the process of
being converted to C#.

## Current issues
The state of the editor right now is broken to say the least. The only working features right now are loading RM2s/SM2s and that's pretty much it
haven't tested anything else really.
Here's the list of what needs to be fixed:

- Model viewing
- GeoData viewing
- Scenery viewing
- Sounds playback
- Buttons working properly(In the future design overwhole)
- Ditch any unnecessery dependency(OpenTK should be suffice for sounds and graphics)
- General code refactoing(Having 6k lines of code file doesn't seem practical)
- More API optimizations?
- A lot of other small stuff

## Compiling
The project requires .NET Framework v4.5 and VisualStudio 2017(2015 might work too) to be compiled.
